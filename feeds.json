You can cache them in memory with node but its not very efficient. I have experienced this definitely, however I do not have any benchmarks. In my use case it was a difference between milliseconds and over a second. \n\nYou could certainly use node to cache template strings; that would still be quick; but lots of large images in binary/base64 would store a minimum of the file size in memory and slow down your server from handling lighter requests.\nBy clustering you would get a quicker response from serving raw files, as you could have 2+ processors serving disc reads (or writes) and using streams would allow better concurrency, however the response of one file streaming to synchronous would be slower in a direct 1-to-1 comparison.\n\nIn reality there are a lot of factors involved in this and every one use-case/situation is different. It really depends on what you are trying to achieve in your project, how many visitors you expect your site/app to get, how many static assets you will be serving, the size of those assets and what hardware resources your server has and/or is available.\n\nIf it is just a small site/prototype with small to medium traffic it will really not make a huge difference.\n\nWith regards to proxying there is not much difference between putting nginx in front of node and using nginx/apache with php or ruby/python with passenger. The only difference is that with php i've not heard of people running a php server on port 80 without nginx or apache, where as with node this is easy and common.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-02-28T21:58:26+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"668443556530715","from":{"name":"Sam Oliver Newman","id":"501489152"},"message":"Also I might add if you do use nginx in front of node and your node process goes down nginx can handle the response to your user more gracefully.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-02-28T22:04:05+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY4NDQzNTU2NTMwNzE1","before":"NjY4MTk4OTE2NTU1MTc5"}}}},{"id":"125499867491756_668330496542021","from":{"name":"Shubham Verma","id":"100005962593626"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAeoGaHIYh27cnW&w=154&h=154&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fgithub%2Fribbons%2Fforkme_right_white_ffffff.png","link":"http://nodemavens.com/","name":"Node Mavens - Sharing Node Love","caption":"nodemavens.com","icon":"https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/668330496542021"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/668330496542021"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"link","created_time":"2014-02-28T17:43:06+0000","updated_time":"2014-02-28T17:43:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001513879998","name":"Gokul Krish"},{"id":"1247545999","name":"Kourosh Sharifi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTI0NzU0NTk5OQ==","before":"MTAwMDAxNTEzODc5OTk4"}}}},{"id":"125499867491756_668235639884840","from":{"name":"Cronos Manta Abaddon","id":"100003320847144"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"message":"any one succeeded installing drywall in windows, I installed and the css is not working, the author of drywall claims he successfully installed in his aging xp windows machine","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/668235639884840"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/668235639884840"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-02-28T14:15:48+0000","updated_time":"2014-02-28T14:15:48+0000"},{"id":"125499867491756_667663123275425","from":{"name":"Paushali Mandal","id":"685388195"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"message":"Anybody interested in reviewing a recently published GruntJS book? \n\nI have a few e-copies of Getting Started with Grunt (http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-grunt-the-javascript-task-runner/book) available for review. \n\nIf interested, just do the following:\n\n1.

In apache web server you can configure to listen only to a set of external IP's (eg 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 apache will respond only to other PCs with IP's 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255 but will not listen/will refuse connection for example from 192.168.1.x) in node you have to write that filter for yourself (sorry no shortcuts or easy solutions)\n\nTo be honest I never tried to experiment with node sockets, maybe it is possible to specify IP/netmask in some way.

It is unexpected to have each parameter in a new line. I personally use separate parameters to form a single string, avoiding +.\n\nThe node function is not intuitive enough. I had to read the description to understand what it was about. I think that a .cb function that takes a string and returns a regular cb we can pass to any node-core function would be better. Additionally a second parameter could be passed to indicate a function to be ran, like this: https://gist.github.com/leostera/7617812\n\nIt's a pity it's written in cs :P not my cup of script, but good work thou!

Then, I decided to run it on headless browsers because this is a multi-thread program and increasing thread number to hundred thousands needs huge amount of resources. After trying different options I chose HtmlUnitDriver as a famous headless browser which is compatible with selenium webdriver.\n\nthe main problem at first was tons of \"WARNING: CSS error:...\" . I disabled those warnings bye disabling javascript support:\n\nHtmlUnitDriver wd1 = new HtmlUnitDriver();\nwd1.setJavascriptEnabled(false);\n\nNow, my client application works without those WARNINGs, but request's response time (I mean response time for each clicks) is much higher in comparison to real Firefox browser.\nMy application executes 100 clients in parallel (multi-threading) and calculates the response time for each request (each client opens my Wordpress blog) . Specifically, the first response time in all clients (which is the first request in each client) are in the order of 12000 ms but next requests are more realistic. However, In real browser (Firefox), first request is usually in the order of 4000 ms.\n\nI appreciate if you help me to find out what is wrong in my setup.\n\nI can provide more information about the source code If you need.\nKindly, help me as soon as because its an emergency case.\n\nI appreciate your supports in advance.\nAmir","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/622232784485126"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/622232784485126"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2013-11-25T14:17:53+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-25T15:37:28+0000","comments":{"data":[{"id":"622247291150342","from":{"name":"S Mert Özdel","id":"100007063955371"},"message":"java's library is new?","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-25T14:40:44+0000","like_count":1,"user_likes":false},{"id":"622272917814446","from":{"name":"Amir Borhani","id":"100002771267695"},"message":"yes. latest version.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-11-25T15:37:28+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjIyMjcyOTE3ODE0NDQ2","before":"NjIyMjQ3MjkxMTUwMzQy"}}}},{"id":"125499867491756_622173947824343","from":{"name":"Julio Elixir","id":"100000237608322"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"message":"Node.Js with Redis database Engine simple CRUD !!!","picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCtoNsM3dvq-5RI&w=154&h=154&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.global.ssl.fastly.net%2Fimages%2Fmodules%2Flogos_page%2FOctocat.png","link":"https://github.com/TXANT/redis_proj","name":"redis_proj","caption":"github.com","description":"redis_proj - Demo project of contact wich using node.Js and redis","icon":"https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/622173947824343"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/622173947824343"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"link","created_time":"2013-11-25T10:55:40+0000","updated_time":"2013-11-25T10:55:40+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100005801469422","name":"Mohammad Amin Jahany"},{"id":"100003564668438","name":"Ilmsg July"},{"id":"695718894","name":"Jean Carlo Nascimento"},{"id":"100002316652439","name":"Lucas Maus"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAyMzE2NjUyNDM5","before":"MTAwMDA1ODAxNDY5NDIy"}}}},{"id":"125499867491756_620599897981748","from":{"name":"Ilias Ismanalijev","id":"100000039453105"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"message":"Visual Studio + Node.js.

I installed nodeworks, and tried the hello world example. I already had node installed, and when I run the example from node directly, I get the server running on port 3000. When I try to verify it from nodeworks, it is unable to locate the home dir. I noticed on the express.js web site, there seems to be a requirement for a package.json to be present for express to work correctly is that right? Also wondering what is the correct way to iterate through argv. Coming from a perl background, argv is for command line arguments. so argv2 would be the second command line argument, but since we are jsut running a server on a specific port, I'm not sure what is intended by re-writing the example to include argv2 instead of the port number, as indicated in the HW example.

It is just far too low level. The wonderful Connect project gave us a nice set of middleware that starts to turn node into a competent web platform, and then Express takes it the rest of the way to be a full web development choice. However, compared to some other modern frameworks, such as Rails, Symfony, Laravel, ASP.NET MVC, etc., it feels a bit lacking and a bit unrefined. Others have answered that call with more complete web frameworks for node, such as Sails.js and Compound.

They‘ve just never got on with each other, despite similarnames. But as the years have worn on, the shunned language is starting to stand up for itself.Our colleague from German-language PHP Magazin, Tom Wießeckel, spoke to JavaScript god Douglas Crockford recently and we thought it was well worth hearing the guru's views on JavaScript, jQuery and CoffeeScript. Tom Wießeckel: I’m here with Douglas Crockford at JavaScript Days 2012 in Cologne. Mr. Crockford, please introduce yourself!Douglas Crockford: I’m Douglas Crockford from Yahoo! Wießeckel: You’re well known as a JavaScript super hero and you just held your keynote at the JavaScript Days. Can you summarize it?Crockford: JavaScript is becoming an important language, but it’s a misunderstood language. So in order to use it well it’s necessary to have specific information and I am trying to help provide that to people. Wießeckel: So why is that misunderstood?Crockford: A lot of it is because of its strange history. You know, the fact that it is called JavaScript. It has nothing to do with Java. It is almost like it was intentional that the name was created to confuse people. Wießeckel: You said something about the good parts and the bad parts. Which one is the worst part?Crockford: The worst part is JavaScript’s reliance and global variables. The security problems that we see in the browser are rooted in that mistake.Wießeckel: After your keynote there was a question about CoffeeScript. Can you repeat?Crockford: CoffeeScript is a new language which compiles into JavaScript. It uses JavaScript as an execution language. CoffeeScript is beautiful and elegant …","icon":"https://fbcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t39.2080-0/851560_578234382210973_1642708285_n.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/478908165484256"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/478908165484256"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"link","application":{"name":"Flipboard","namespace":"flipboard","id":"105130332854716"},"created_time":"2012-12-27T21:16:35+0000","updated_time":"2013-01-04T19:57:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100000331502490","name":"Rafael"},{"id":"667400914","name":"Marco Godínez"},{"id":"695718894","name":"Jean Carlo Nascimento"},{"id":"534036977","name":"Alexandro Colorado"},{"id":"100001928850416","name":"Hyago Rios"},{"id":"100001263104465","name":"Omar López Orendain"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTAwMDAxMjYzMTA0NDY1","before":"MTAwMDAwMzMxNTAyNDkw"}}},"comments":{"data":[{"id":"478918435483229","from":{"name":"Omar López Orendain","id":"100001263104465"},"message":"Crockford is a badass, thanks for sharing :)","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2012-12-27T21:54:00+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"482659861775753","from":{"name":"Azharuddin Khan","id":"1367671849"},"message":"crockford really is a killer pro.. man he is a scientist tbh","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2013-01-04T19:57:13+0000","like_count":0,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NDgyNjU5ODYxNzc1NzUz","before":"NDc4OTE4NDM1NDgzMjI5"}}}},{"id":"125499867491756_482243098484096","from":{"name":"Juanjo Fernández","id":"1753096186"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"link":"http://www.readability.com/articles/vr06reup","name":"Developing Backbone.js Applications -","caption":"www.readability.com","description":"Developing Backbone.js Applications By Addy Osmani @addyosmani Prelude Welcome to my (in-progress) book about the Backbone.js framework for structuring JavaScript applications.

You can cache them in memory with node but its not very efficient. I have experienced this definitely, however I do not have any benchmarks. In my use case it was a difference between milliseconds and over a second. \n\nYou could certainly use node to cache template strings; that would still be quick; but lots of large images in binary/base64 would store a minimum of the file size in memory and slow down your server from handling lighter requests.\nBy clustering you would get a quicker response from serving raw files, as you could have 2+ processors serving disc reads (or writes) and using streams would allow better concurrency, however the response of one file streaming to synchronous would be slower in a direct 1-to-1 comparison.\n\nIn reality there are a lot of factors involved in this and every one use-case/situation is different. It really depends on what you are trying to achieve in your project, how many visitors you expect your site/app to get, how many static assets you will be serving, the size of those assets and what hardware resources your server has and/or is available.\n\nIf it is just a small site/prototype with small to medium traffic it will really not make a huge difference.\n\nWith regards to proxying there is not much difference between putting nginx in front of node and using nginx/apache with php or ruby/python with passenger. The only difference is that with php i've not heard of people running a php server on port 80 without nginx or apache, where as with node this is easy and common.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-02-28T21:58:26+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false},{"id":"668443556530715","from":{"name":"Sam Oliver Newman","id":"501489152"},"message":"Also I might add if you do use nginx in front of node and your node process goes down nginx can handle the response to your user more gracefully.","can_remove":false,"created_time":"2014-02-28T22:04:05+0000","like_count":2,"user_likes":false}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"NjY4NDQzNTU2NTMwNzE1","before":"NjY4MTk4OTE2NTU1MTc5"}}}},{"id":"125499867491756_668330496542021","from":{"name":"Shubham Verma","id":"100005962593626"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"picture":"https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAeoGaHIYh27cnW&w=154&h=154&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fgithub%2Fribbons%2Fforkme_right_white_ffffff.png","link":"http://nodemavens.com/","name":"Node Mavens - Sharing Node Love","caption":"nodemavens.com","icon":"https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/668330496542021"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/668330496542021"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"link","created_time":"2014-02-28T17:43:06+0000","updated_time":"2014-02-28T17:43:06+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001513879998","name":"Gokul Krish"},{"id":"1247545999","name":"Kourosh Sharifi"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTI0NzU0NTk5OQ==","before":"MTAwMDAxNTEzODc5OTk4"}}}},{"id":"125499867491756_668235639884840","from":{"name":"Cronos Manta Abaddon","id":"100003320847144"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"message":"any one succeeded installing drywall in windows, I installed and the css is not working, the author of drywall claims he successfully installed in his aging xp windows machine","actions":[{"name":"Comment","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/668235639884840"},{"name":"Like","link":"https://www.facebook.com/125499867491756/posts/668235639884840"}],"privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-02-28T14:15:48+0000","updated_time":"2014-02-28T14:15:48+0000"},{"id":"125499867491756_667663123275425","from":{"name":"Paushali Mandal","id":"685388195"},"to":{"data":[{"name":"node.js","id":"125499867491756"}]},"message":"Anybody interested in reviewing a recently published GruntJS book? \n\nI have a few e-copies of Getting Started with Grunt (http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-grunt-the-javascript-task-runner/book) available for review. \n\nIf interested, just do the following:\n\n1.

In apache web server you can configure to listen only to a set of external IP's (eg 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 apache will respond only to other PCs with IP's 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255 but will not listen/will refuse connection for example from 192.168.1.x) in node you have to write that filter for yourself (sorry no shortcuts or easy solutions)\n\nTo be honest I never tried to experiment with node sockets, maybe it is possible to specify IP/netmask in some way.
